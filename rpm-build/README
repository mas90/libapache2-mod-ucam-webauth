This directory contains the files actually necessary to build an RPM
from scratch. However if you just want an RPM you'd do better to
install and then rebuild one of the source RPMs that are distributed
from 

  http://raven.cam.ac.uk/project/apache/

But if you _really_ want to build from this, do the following:

  1) Copy the .tar distribution file to <wherever>/SOURCE

  2) Copy README.KEYS to <wherever>/SOURCE

  3) Copy the correct .spec file to <wherever>/SPEC

  4) Run rpmbuild on the spec file
