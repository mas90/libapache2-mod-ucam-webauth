This directory is the location in which the Apache mod_ucam_webauth
module expects by default to find the public key(s) used to verify

AAKeyDir configuration directive.

For the University of Cambridge Raven service, the current keys can be
collected from

mod_ucam_webauth uses only the PEM formated PKCS#1 format files
(stored in files named pubkey<n>).
