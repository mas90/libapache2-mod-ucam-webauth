     ===============================================================

     2. MacOS
     3. Red Hat, Fedora
     4. SuSE Linux
     5. Windows

1. Debian/Ubuntu
================

In versions below Ubuntu 14.04 "trusty" and Debian 8 "jessie", only
Apache 2.2 is available. From those releases onwards, only Apache 2.4
is available. Installing the appropriate .deb file (see INSTALL for
more details on how to obtain/build an appropriate .deb for your
system) will install the module correctly; you can enable it with the
command "a2enmod ucam_webauth". It will still require configuration to
meet your needs, however.

apxs is installed as /usr/bin/apxs2

Apache runs with a ServerRoot of /etc/apache2/

The module should be installed into
/usr/lib/apache2/modules/. According to Debian/Ubuntu conventions, it
should be loaded from a file in /etc/apache2/mods-available called
ucam_webauth.load containing:

  LoadModule ucam_webauth_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_ucam_webauth.so

Initial configuration directives (probably including AACookieKey)
should appear in a file in the same directory called
ucam_webauth.conf. If this file contains a Cookie Key it should only
be readable by root. Modules are enabled by symlinking to their .load
and .conf files from the /etc/apache2/mods-enabled directory - the
utility a2enmod should be used to create the symlinks.

The authn_core module must be loaded for ucam_webauth to work.

Alternatively, the module could be loaded with a LoadModule line in
apache2.conf, or in a *.conf file in /etc/apache2/conf.d/, or otherwise in
a file included into apache2.conf:

  LoadModule ucam_webauth_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_ucam_webauth.so

The keys will by default be searched for in

  /etc/apache2/conf/webauth_keys/

Apache logs are stored in /var/log/apache2/


2. MacOS (10.5 and later)
======================================

Only Apache 2 is available.

The recommended process is to download the installer package
ModUcamWebauth-<ver>.pkg.zip and install that.

https://wiki.csx.cam.ac.uk/raven/Installing_the_Apache_authentication_module_under_MacOS_X

for more details.


3. Red Hat, Fedora
==================

Only Apache 2 is available

apxs is installed as /usr/sbin/apxs

Apache runs with a ServerRoot of /etc/httpd/

The module should be installed into /usr/lib/httpd/modules/,
(a.k.a. /etc/httpd/modules/ via a symlink). It should be loaded with a
LoadModule line in httpd.conf, or in a *.conf file in
/etc/httpd/conf.d/, or otherwise in a file included into httpd.conf:

  LoadModule ucam_webauth_module modules/mod_ucam_webauth.so

The keys will by default be searched for in

  /etc/httpd/conf/webauth_keys/

Apache logs are stored in /var/log/httpd/


4. SuSE Linux
=============

Apache 2
--------

Apache 2 is provided by the apache2 package. This provides Apache 2.0
in SLES 9 and SuSE Linux 10.0; it provides Apache 2.2 in SLES 10, SuSE
Linux 10.1 and OpenSuSE 10.2.

apxs is installed as /usr/sbin/apxs2. Alternate versions
(apxs2-prefork, apxs2-worker, etc) are available for building modules
customised for particular MPMs (see
/usr/share/doc/packages/apache2/README.SUSE)

Apache runs with a ServerRoot of /srv/www/

The module should installed into /usr/lib/apache2/ (/usr/lib64/apache2/
on 64-bit systems). It should be loaded by adding 'ucam_webauth' to
the list of modules assigned to the APACHE_MODULES key in
/etc/sysconfig/apache2 (the utility a2enmod can be used to manipulate
this list). For older versions of SuSE it will be necessary to run

  SuSEconfig --module apache2

to bring this change into operation, later versions do this
automatically when Apache is restarted. Either way, all the modules in
/usr/lib/apache2/ will be symlinked from /usr/lib/apache2-prefork/,
/usr/lib/apache2-worker, etc, depending in which Apache MPM is in use.

Alternatively, the module could be loaded with a LoadModule line in
httpd.conf, or in a *.conf file in /etc/apache/conf.d/, or otherwise in
a file included into httpd.conf:

  LoadModule ucam_webauth_module /usr/lib/apache2/mod_ucam_webauth.so

or

  LoadModule ucam_webauth_module /usr/lib64/apache2/mod_ucam_webauth.so

The keys will by default be searched for in

  /srv/www/conf/webauth_keys/

It might be better to use the AAKeyDir directive to relocate this to
something like /etc/apache2/webauth_keys/. The SuSE RPMs will by
default create /etc/apache2/webauth_keys/ and make
/srv/www/conf/webauth_keys a symlink to it.

Apache logs are stored in /var/log/httpd/


5. Windows
==========

All versions
------------

See README.WIN32. Binary builds of the module are available - the
correct binary module must be used to match the version of Apache in
use (2.2 or 2.4).

By default, the Apache project binary installer installs into one of
the following. This is the default ServerRoot:

  C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Apache2.2\ [Apache 2.2]
  C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Apache2.4\ [Apache 2.4]

The module should be installed into the modules\ directory within the
apache directory. The 'Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable
Package' supplied in the file vcredist_x86.exe or vcredist_x64.exe
(for 32-bit or 64-bit versions of Windows) must be installed if not
already present.

The module should be loaded with a LoadModule line in httpd.conf or
otherwise in a file included into httpd.conf:

  LoadModule ucam_webauth_module modules/mod_ucam_webauth.so

The keys will by default be searched for in conf\webauth_keys\ within
the installation directory.

Apache logs are stored in the logs\ directory within the installation
directory.
